cat("Hello, My name is Akshay Dajee and I am currently a Senior in the Tepper School of Business 
at Carnegie Mellon University. I am double majoring in Finance and Statistics. 
Recently, I accepted an offer to work for an investment bank called Cowen where I will
be working in the M&A division in the Healthcare group. I have been selected to talk 
to you about Earth. So let me go over a couple of key things. There are 7 continents, lots of
countries. While you are here you should visit some. Spain is my favorite country. I am grouping
there over Winter Break. You guys should also go to the movie theater while you are here. 
Humans like to make these 2 hour motion pictures that they called movies. They are pretty cool.
The new avengers movie is playing, I heard it is good. Another thing you should do is 
go to New York and eat some hot dogs or italian sausages. Also pizza. Great food.I would love to
learn more about you and your people. What do you call yourselves? Do you guys have multiple
languages you guys speak?")
